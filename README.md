## description:
Create a quiz game where the user has a certain amount of time in which to answer questions. The game ends once the timer runs out or there are no more questions to answer. Work with local storage to allow users to add to a high scores list.

Test it out [here](https://chenallee.github.io/coding-quiz/).

## made in Visual Studio using:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## final thoughts:
Although I was comfortable figuring out the basic game logic, I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to interact with the DOM and conceptualizing hiding different divs to simulate different "screens". While the project is functional, I am not particularly happy with the sloppiness of how I executed it.

Currently, my code is very messy and I'd like to go through it again to improve it for both readability and efficiency as well as implementing new features. 

Since I now have some basics down on how to interact with the DOM to allow the user interactivity, I'll continue to internalize those concepts and improve my coding process.
